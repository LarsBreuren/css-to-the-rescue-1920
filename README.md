## Design patterns ##
For the design i went with a japanese style, the posters Vasilis showed us the first lecture inspired me for the design.
Because of the restriction i only was able to use 2 colours what was quite a challange, eventually by using alot of diffrent shapes and animations i think i managed to make a nice design out of it.

## Nice to haves ##
* Removing that one evenlistener
* Cool animation on the body background when the eye is pressed 
* Better design for the menu's
